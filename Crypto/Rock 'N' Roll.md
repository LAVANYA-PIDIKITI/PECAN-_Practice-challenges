# Rock 'N' Roll
Difficulty:   
Les Claypool of Rock band 'Primus' released an old notebook to the public, which consisted of scribbled lyrics forming some of their biggest hits.
One of the pages has words which resemble the lyrics of their song 'Jerry Was A Race Car Driver', but the words seem a little too strange just to be lyrics:

"Jerry was a racecar driver, Knock Jerry down, Build Jerry up. Captain Pierce was a strong man, Put Jerry with Captain Pierce into The Racecar."

Find the secret within these lyrics and submit as a flag
